# After	School	Program	Check	Out	App

# Overview

I	am	an	instructor	for	an	after	school	program,	grades k	- 		8 .	One	part	of	the	job	that	I	think
would	benefit	from	being	automated	is student	check	out.		We	check	the	students	out	by
ticking	a paper	list.	There are 	1	 - 2	instructors	per	class,	and	a	check	out app	would be	useful,	as
both	instructors	could	check out	students	on	their	phones	at	the	same	time,	with	the	app
updating	automatically.

Students	could	be	categorized	into	pickup	by	adult,	walk	home alone,	and	after	school	program.
The	students	that	are	picked	up	by	an	adult	and	the	ones	that	go	to	after	school	care,	need to
be	checked	off	when	the event	happens – so	these	cases	would	be	marked	priority	on	the	app.
The	app	would	need	an	option	to	mark	a	student	as	absent.

# Features

**Photo	upload** - Option	to	add	parents’ photographs,	for	better	security.
**Time	recorder** - Time	automatically	recorded	when	student	is checked	out.
**Link	to	phone** - Quick	dial	to	parent’s	phones.
**Absent option** – students	marked	as	absent.
**Input	form** – parents	input	information.

# Technologies
